# PrivateChannels

Discord bot that creates a private channel for the users so they can talk in a private voicechat without adding each other

## What does it do?

The bot will create a parent channel if it doesn't exsist yet and create private channels under the parent.
the channels will be named by the users id so the bot doesnt require to log who owns what channel.
you can invite/kick people to your own private channel so you can decide who joins your channel.

to get a list of the commands and get started with the bot just type /privatehelp and the bot sends you all the commands
